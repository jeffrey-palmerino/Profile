# *Intelligent Self-Adaptive Simulation Service (IS3)*
*IS3* simulates a self-adaptive system with multiple adaption possibilities that have varying latency distributions. This tool implements the MAPE-K adaptation control loop for all self-adaptation decisions, with the option to embed multiple utility equations in the "Plan" phase of the loop.  

### Technology
*IS3* is written in Java 8 and is still being created. It implements the MAPE-K adaptation control loop which is a feedback loop that is the most influential reference control model for autonomic and self-adaptive systems. Once it is made open-source, it can be downloaded into any IDE for modification on a local machine.
