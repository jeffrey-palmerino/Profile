# *"Reducing Tactic Latency Uncertainty in Self-Adaptive Systems"*
A paper submitted to SEAMS 2018; Published: TBD

## Abstract
Tactic latency is the time between when a tactic is started and when its effect is produced. Fortunately, many self-adaptive techniques are beginning to account for latency in their decision-making process. These adaptation processes consider tactic latency to be a static, human defined value. Unfortunately, many tactics have a volatile latency value; one that may be constantly changing. In this work, we present a Latency Volatility Aware (LVA) adaptation process. We achieved positive results evaluating LVA in several environments against a baseline process that only considers static latency values. We found that accounting for latency volatility can have a positive impact on the adaptation decision process, specifically by making the system more resilient to large variations in tactic latency. To support the evaluation of LVA, we created *TacSim*, a tool which enables us to quickly simulate multiple adaptation decisions while accounting for uncertainty in tactic latency. This paper advances the self-adaptive decision-making process by reducing tactic latency uncertainty. Our discoveries can serve as a foundation for future work in reducing uncertainty through understanding and accounting for tactic latency volatility.
